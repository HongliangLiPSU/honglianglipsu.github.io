### Research Summary
My research focuses on the intersection of optimization theory, control systems, and generative models, with a particular emphasis on developing hierarchical decision-making frameworks that enable manufacturing systems to operate more efficiently, sustainably, and responsively to dynamic market and energy conditions.
