I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University, advised by [Prof. Ilya Kovalenko](https://www.caislab.com/) and [Prof. Herschel Pangborn](http://www.paclab.info/). I build advanced optimization and learning algorithms, as well as planning and digital twin tools, to make complex networked systems more efficient and reliable. Before Penn State, I was a Research Associate at the [Surbana Jurong–Nanyang Technological University Corporate Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sj-ntu), working on waste energy recovery. I earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tianjin University.
