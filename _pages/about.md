Hi, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University, advised by [Prof. Ilya Kovalenko](https://www.caislab.com/) and [Prof. Herschel Pangborn](http://www.paclab.info/).
Before Penn State, I was a Research Associate at the [Surbana Jurong–Nanyang Technological University Corporate Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sj-ntu), working on concrete 3D printing and waste energy recovery. I earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tianjin University. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and golf, cooking, and exploring photography.

 I build advanced optimization and learning algorithms, as well as planning and digital twin tools, to make complex networked systems more efficient and reliable. I’m currently exploring internship and full-time opportunities beginning in May 2026. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect.
