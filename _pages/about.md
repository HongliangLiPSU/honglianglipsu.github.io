I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University, advised by [Prof. Ilya Kovalenko](https://www.caislab.com/) and [Prof. Herschel Pangborn](http://www.paclab.info/). Before joining Penn State University, I was a Research Associate at [Surbana Jurong Nanyang Technological University Corporate Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sj-ntu), working on wasted energy recoveries. I hold B.S. and M.S. from Tianjin University. I developed advanced optimization and learning algorithms, as well as planning and digital twin tools, to enhance the efficiency and reliability of networked multi-agent systems, including manufacturing systems and supply chains.
